## My process

I first built the initial layout and then coded the repsonsive elements (i.e., changing layout for smaller screens). I did not struggle with coding the initial layout but 

### Built with
- VsCode
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge looked easy at first. However, coding to have different images and layout for smaller screens were a bit tough for me. I looked a couple of different posts to see how I can implement a new img file for different screen sizes. That led to using "picture" element. Finally, I also did not use media queries before and I had to write simple ones for the webpage to render differently on cell phones. Also, I tried to use more semantic elements rather than divs in this challenge. 


### Continued development

I'd like to learn more about media queries. I think I used them correctly in this design, however I feel like there is so much more that I could also do with them. 

I had to use max-width in CSS for this layout to work. I feel like I do not know exactly when to use max-width and width. 


### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23414817/load-images-based-on-screen-size) - This helped me implementing different images based on screen size. I did not use CSS bur rather htmpl picture element for this purpose.
